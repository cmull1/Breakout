## Notes on Related Projects
So, I found some articles telling how to add audio with pygame to a python file. 
(https://opensource.com/article/20/9/add-sound-python-game)
This website teaches readers how what to do with soundfiles and presents links to other sites that can help coders.
One of my findings, was that for audio it is recommended to convert an audio file from the format of mp3 to ogg in order to lower the file size.
