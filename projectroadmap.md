# Notes on Related Projects
So, I found some articles telling how to add audio with pygame to a python file. 
(https://opensource.com/article/20/9/add-sound-python-game)
This website teaches readers how what to do with soundfiles and presents links to other sites that can help coders.
One of my findings, was that for audio it is recommended to convert an audio file from the format of mp3 to ogg in order to lower the file size.

I also looked at this here
https://github.com/felipead/breakout
Which unfortunately was not able to run. The comments and commits were hard to follow and were hard to understand.
When trying to run it, it would open via shell script. Then it would show an error with alot of text for a split second, then close itself.
I think the reason it does not open properly (and other similar Breakout projects in Github) do not work is having to due with the shell script or the Windows Batch File.
